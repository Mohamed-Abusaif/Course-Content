✅ 1. What is the difference between <div> and <span>? When would you use each?
Answer:
<div> is a block-level element used to group larger chunks of content or layout sections.
<span> is an inline element used to style or isolate parts of text inside block-level elements.

Use <div> for layout containers.

Use <span> for inline text styling or targeting.
===================================================================================================
✅ 2. What are semantic HTML elements? Give examples and explain their importance.
Answer:
Semantic elements describe their content meaningfully to both the browser and developer.
Examples: <header>, <footer>, <main>, <article>, <nav>

They improve accessibility, SEO, and code readability.
===================================================================================================
✅ 3. What is the difference between id and class attributes in HTML?
Answer:

id: Unique identifier (used once per page), e.g., id="header"

class: Reusable label to group elements with similar styles or behaviors, e.g., class="button"

Use id for unique elements and class for styling or grouping.

✅ 4. What is the purpose of the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration? What happens if it’s missing?
Answer:

Declares the document type and HTML version (HTML5 in this case).

It tells the browser to render the page in standards-compliant mode.

If omitted, browsers may switch to quirks mode, causing inconsistent rendering.

✅ 5. Explain the difference between block-level and inline elements.
Answer:

Block-level: Takes up the full width, starts on a new line. E.g., <div>, <p>, <section>

Inline: Takes up only as much width as necessary, flows within a line. E.g., <span>, <a>, <strong>

✅ 6. How do you make a form accessible for screen readers and assistive technologies?
Answer:

Always use <label for="inputId"> paired with the corresponding <input id="inputId">

Use semantic HTML and ARIA roles if needed.

Ensure proper tab order and descriptive placeholders/alt text.
===================================================================================================

✅ 7. What is the difference between <section>, <article>, and <aside>?
Answer:

<section>: A thematic grouping of content, usually with a heading.

<article>: Self-contained content, reusable and distributable (like a blog post).

<aside>: Tangential or complementary content (sidebars, callouts).
